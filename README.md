## SLA Buddy: a helpful robot to help you meet Service Level Agreement in Slack.

This bot started as an internal tooling project to help enforce and meet SLAs at [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase). It borrows many mechanisms and most of the functionality designed in [supa_queue](https://github.com/mansueli/supa_queue) while extending them to be a standalone product. 

## Pre-requisites

   - pg_cron
   - pg_net

## How it works:

Here's the top-level diagram explaining how it works: 
![slabuddy drawio](https://github.com/mansueli/slabuddy/assets/5036432/44c35c61-9120-4e82-adf4-2a984da7c87a)

- It monitors for new tickets in a few slack channels. For example, you could set different priorities depending on the Tier/Plan of your customer.
- If there is no message after an `X` amount of time, then it will post on the channels to alert people working in support.

- You can respond in the thread with a `@mention` to the bot, so they will know you acknowledged the ticket and will delay future comms in 30 min. 

## Installing

### Get a Supabase Project
 - Setup a Supabase project for the bot [here](https://database.new)
 - Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started#installing-the-supabase-cli)
 - Login to your Supabase instance in the CLI
 - Run the [initial.sql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mansueli/slabuddy/main/supabase/migrations/initial.sql) in the database.
 - Deploy the Supabase Edge Functions (Pick the one for your help platform or edit if your platform isn't supported yet)

   
### Integrate Help Platform with Slack

It will depend on the integrations available but we recommend setting each slack channel for each level of Priority you have example: (Enterprise, Teams, Pro, Free). 
This allows you to set different SLA enforcements on each of them.


### Deploy Bot to Slack:

*Use this manifest to create the bot:* 

```manifest.yml
