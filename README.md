## SLA Buddy: a helpful robot to help you meet Service Level Agreement in Slack.

This bot started as an internal tooling project to help enforce and meet SLAs at [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase). It borrows many mechanisms and most of the functionality designed in [supa_queue](https://github.com/mansueli/supa_queue) while extending them to be a standalone product.

## How it works:

Here's the top-level diagram explaining how it works: 
![slabuddy drawio](https://github.com/mansueli/slabuddy/assets/5036432/adf2c343-e978-46cb-9d9b-d4ea0bbff54d)

- It monitors for new tickets in a few slack channels. For example, you could set different priorities depending on the Tier/Plan of your customer.
- If there is no message after an `X` amount of time, then it will post on the channels to alert people working in support.

- You can respond in the thread with a `@mention` to the bot, so they will know you acknowledged the ticket and will delay future comms in 30 min.
